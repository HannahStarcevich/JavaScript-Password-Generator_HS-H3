The goal of this project was to develop a simple website interface and easy to use password generator. The password generated includes a completely random selection of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. 

Elements used in this project: JavaScript functions, for loops, events, methods arrays and more. 

This website demonstrates my first fully developed and launched JavaScript code.
